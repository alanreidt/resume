## Experience

### Frontend Developer at Planeta.ru

Planeta.ru — well-established Russian crowdfunding platform.

#### January 2025 — July 2025 (7 months)

Developed the client-side of the online store Atmosfera (atmosfera.store), including the admin panel. The store is part of the Planeta.ru service, selling results of crowdfunding campaigns and unique lots from project authors.

**Tech Stack:** React, React Router, React Hook Form, Material UI, Effector, Effector-forms, Redux, RTK Query, TypeScript, zod, CSS Modules (with SCSS), Git, Gitea, Yarn, Razzle (Webpack), OpenAPI, Figma, Redmine (similar to Jira).

- Boosted page performance by upgrading Swiper.js from version 6 to 12, which enabled the use of native lazy loading for images and eliminated bugs from older versions. This accelerated development and reduced page load times for image-heavy pages.

#### January 2023 — March 2024 (1 year and 3 months)

Led the frontend development for two products:

- Planeta ID: Independently developed and launched the Planeta ID single sign-on service, integrating it into the Planeta.ru ecosystem.

**Tech Stack:** React, React Router, Effector, Effector-forms, TypeScript, CSS Modules (SCSS), Git, Gitea, Yarn, Razzle (Webpack), OpenAPI, Figma, Redmine (similar to Jira).

- Boosted page performance by 52% (from a Lighthouse score of 44 to 67) by fixing a critical SSR issue.

### Frontend Developer at Yandex

**Tech Stack:** React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, React Query, React Table, Formik, TypeScript, CSS-in-JS, Git, Github, Npm, Figma, Jira.

- Optimized the application by removing redundant technologies (SSR, Redux), resulting in a 30% reduction in bundle size, a 30% increase in build speed, and improved code maintainability.
